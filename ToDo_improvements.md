## To do list 

Improvements for the next version of the master backup strategy (V1.4).

### Desktop

- [ ] Take Clonezilla backups over LAN to NAS. Proof of concept.


### Cloud

- [ ] Implement rsync methodology to back up cPanels automatically, via rsync. Source; Web hosting cPanels. Destination: NAS (test on desktop).

- [ ] pCloud daily pull to NAS and B2 without using S3 or deskotp as intermediary clouds. Is there a way?
