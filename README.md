# Master Backup Strategy
By: Daniel Rosehill (github@danielrosehill.co.il)

This "master" backup strategy summarizes the overall backup strategy that I currently use to back up my local and cloud data in compliance with the 3-2-1 backup approach:

*3 extant copies of all critical data
*2 backup copies
-> Copies on different storage media
*1 copy stored off-site
